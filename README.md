# Real-time-identification-of-medicinal-plants
This project aims to develop a system that can identify medicinal plants in real-time using machine learning techniques. The system will use image recognition algorithms to analyze images of the plants and classify them based on their species. The database of medicinal plants will be collected and labeled for training the model. The system will be able to identify the plant, display information about its medicinal properties, and provide information on how it can be used for treatment. This project will have several potential applications in the fields of botany, herbal medicine, and healthcare. The real-time identification of medicinal plants will help to preserve and spread knowledge about the therapeutic properties of these plants, making them more accessible to people who need them.
